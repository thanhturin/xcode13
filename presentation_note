2.1. Autocompletion

    2.1.1 auto import modules
        ```
            let color = UIColor.red
            let text = Text("")
            let player: AVPlayer
        ```
        - Tip: This will only work with protocols that are already imported somewhere else in your project. It won’t read all types in unrelated protocols.

    2.1.2 unwrap optional 
        - func setCornerRadius(for view: UIView, cornerRadius: CGFloat?)

    2.1.3 autocomplete properties inside properties
        - As you’re typing view.corn Xcode will offer view.layer.cornerRadius as a completion
        - 2 layers only
        ```
        struct AAA {
            let name: String
        }

        struct BBB {
            let aaa: AAA
        }

        struct CCC {
            let bbb: BBB
        }

        let bbb = BBB(aaa: AAA(name: "aaa"))
        let ccc = CCC(bbb: bbb)
        ```

    2.1.4 for loop for flural and singular
        ```
            for person in people {
                <#body#>
            }

            for baby in babies {

            }

            for fish in fish {
                
            }
        ```
            
    2.1.5 switch case
        ```
        enum Fruit {
            case apple
            case banana
            case orange

            var color: UIColor {
                switch self {
                    
                }
            }
        }

        func handleResponse(_ completion: Result<Int, Error>) {
            switch completion {

            }
        }
        ```

2.2. Breakpoint
    2.2.1 Column breakpoint
        - Right click --> Show Code Actions
        - Check after I squared a number, how many is greater than 10.
        ```
        func run() {
            var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
            let result = arr.map { $0 * $0 }.filter { $0 > 10 }.count
        }
        ```
    2.2.2 Symnolic breakpoint (optional)
        - Add breakpoint for all function with the name matching a regex

3. Source control (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10205/)
    - Source control is not new in Xcode 
    - But there are few interesting improvement in this version

    3.1 Code review
        - Highlight changes more indicatively
        - See all changes in `Changes` tab on Source Control Navigator
            - It's not new, it's just more visible
        - Can choose inline for side-by-side
        - Jump to changes
        - Compare between arbitrary commits 
    3.1 Pull request

4. Cloud build
